However, concerns about safety due to the instability and the lid's fit were mentioned, reflecting a need for careful handling. Overall, it seems that while there are some trade-offs in terms of stability and size, the silicone steamer is valued by those who prioritize convenience and speedy cooking for smaller meal preparations.", "The reviews for this steamer are mixed. Some reviewers are satisfied with its ease of use, speed, and ability to steam vegetables and fish quickly and evenly. However, others have issues with the steamer's stability, flexibility, and tendency to spill or dump hot food. Some reviewers also mention that the steamer is small and may only be suitable for single servings or possibly two. Despite these issues, many reviewers mention that the steamer makes their vegetables taste better and helps them stick to their weight loss goals.", "This is a great little steamer. I use it all the time. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store. The only thing I don't like about it is that the lid doesn't stay on. I have to take it out of the microwave to clean it. Other than that, I love it.", "This is a great little steamer. It is easy to use and easy to clean. I like the fact that it is silicone. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is a little flimsy. I have to be careful when taking it out of the microwave.", "The reviews indicate mixed opinions on a silicone steamer mainly used for vegetables and small portions. Some customers appreciate its fast cooking time, ease of cleaning, easy portion control, and the convenience of eating directly from the container. Others express concerns with its flexibility leading to spills and difficulty in handling when hot. The small size and flimsy structure were noted by multiple users. Overall, the steamer proved useful for individuals aiming for healthier eating habits and single servings, whilst the design and handling challenges may need improvement for a more convenient experience."], "fl": [[3, 5, 5], [4, 5, 5], [4, 5, 5], [3, 5, 5], [4, 5, 5], [3, 5, 5], [3, 5, 5], [1, 2, 2], [5, 5, 5], [3, 5, 5], [3, 5, 5], [3, 5, 5], [4, 5, 5]], "co": [[3, 5, 5], [4, 5, 3], [3, 4, 5], [3, 5, 5], [3, 5, 5], [3, 5, 5], [3, 5, 4], [1, 1, 3], [5, 5, 4], [2, 5, 5], [3, 5, 5], [3, 5, 5], [3, 5, 5]], "re": [[3, 5, 3], [3, 5, 3], [3, 5, 3], [3, 5, 4], [3, 5, 5], [3, 5, 5], [3, 5, 4], [1, 2, 3], [5, 5, 3], [3, 4, 4], [3, 4, 3], [3, 4, 4], [4, 5, 4]], "fa": [[3, 5, 5], [4, 5, 5], [4, 5, 5], [3, 5, 5], [2, 5, 5], [3, 5, 5], [3, 5, 5], [1, 1, 2], [5, 5, 4], [2, 5, 4], [2, 2, 3], [3, 3, 3], [3, 5, 5]], "ac": [[2, 4, 4], [3, 5, 5], [3, 5, 5], [2, 4, 5], [2, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5], [3, 5, 5], [1, 1, 2], [5, 5, 5], [2, 4, 5], [2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 3], [4, 5, 5]], "sc": [[2, 3, 5], [3, 5, 5], [3, 3, 5], [2, 3, 5], [2, 3, 5], [2, 4, 5], [2, 4, 5], [1, 2, 2], [5, 5, 5], [3, 3, 5], [2, 2, 5], [2, 3, 5], [3, 4, 5]], "sp": [[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 5], [2, 4, 5], [2, 2, 5], [1, 4, 5], [1, 3, 5], [2, 3, 5], [1, 1, 2], [5, 4, 5], [1, 2, 5], [1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 4], [3, 3, 5]]}
