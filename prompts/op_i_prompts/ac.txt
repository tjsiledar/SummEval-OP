Task Description:
You will be given a set of reviews using which a summary has been generated. Your task is to evaluate the summary based on the given metric. Evaluate to which extent does the summary follows the given metric considering the reviews as the input. Use the following evaluation criteria to judge the extent to which the metric is followed. Make sure you understand the task and the following evaluation metric very clearly.

Evaluation Criteria:
The task is to judge the extent to which the metric is followed by the summary.
Following are the scores and the evaluation criteria according to which scores must be assigned.
<score>1</score> - The metric is not followed at all while generating the summary from the reviews
<score>2</score> - The metric is followed only to a limited extent while generating the summary from the reviews
<score>3</score> - The metric is followed to a good extent while generating the summary from the reviews.
<score>4</score> - The metric is followed mostly while generating the summary from the reviews.
<score>5</score> - The metric is followed completely while generating the summary from the reviews.

Metric:
Aspect Coverage - The summary should cover all the aspects that are majorly being discussed in the reviews. Summaries should be penalized if they miss out on an aspect that was majorly being discussed in the reviews and awarded if it covers all.

Summary:

Evaluation Steps:

Follow the following steps strictly while giving the response:
1. First write down the steps that are needed to evaluate the summary as per the metric. Reiterate what metric you will be using to evaluate the summary.
2. Give a step-by-step explanation if the summary adheres to the metric considering the reviews as the input. Stick to the metric only for evaluation.  
3. Next, evaluate the extent to which the metric is followed.
3. Use the previous information to rate the summary using the evaluation criteria and assign a score within the <score></score> tags.

Note: Strictly give the score within <score></score> tags only e.g Score- <score>5</score>.

First give a detailed explanation and then finally give a single score following the format: Score- <score>5</score>

THE EVALUATION AND SCORE MUST BE ASSIGNED STRICTLY ACCORDING TO THE METRIC ONLY AND NOTHING ELSE!
