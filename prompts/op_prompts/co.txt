Task Description:
You will be given a set of reviews and a corresponding summary. Make sure you understand the following evaluation metric very clearly. Your task is to rate the summary corresponding to the given reviews on the evaluation criteria.

Evaluation Criteria:
Coherence - The collective quality of all sentences. The summary should be well-structured and well-organized. The summary should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from sentence to a coherent body of information.
Following are the scores and the evaluation criteria according to which scores must be assigned.
<score>1</score> - The summary lacks structure and logical flow, resulting in disjointed ideas and significant inconsistencies, making it confusing and challenging to follow.
<score>2</score> - The summary attempts coherence but struggles with occasional lapses in logic, clarity issues, and insufficiently connected ideas, leading to a somewhat disjointed presentation.
<score>3</score> - The summary displays a reasonable level of coherence with a logical sequence, yet occasional disruptions in flow and clarity, requiring some improvements for a smoother transition between ideas.
<score>4</score> - The summary demonstrates strong coherence, maintaining a clear and organized flow with effective transitions and minimal inconsistencies, effectively conveying main points with clarity and precision.
<score>5</score> - The summary showcases exceptional coherence with a flawless logical flow, impeccable transitions, and consistent clarity, presenting information in an impeccably organized and easily comprehensible manner.
